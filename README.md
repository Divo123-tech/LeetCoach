# LeetCoach
<h2>LeetCoach provides hints for LeetCode problems to enhance your coding skills.</h2>
<p>Leetcode is hard! <strong>But it's not impossible</strong>,<br> and as annoying as it may be, its a secret handshake that, if done right, can land you that dream developer job. I ran into a problem whenever I did Leetcode. Every time I would work on a new problem, I would be stuck and the only way out would be to look at solutions. However, all this did, was make me more stuck when coming across new problems. What I found to be most productive was having a friend with me that would guide me through the problem and help me solve it, without giving me the solution. This is what I built LeetCoach for! 
LeetCoach is a powerful extension that leverages prompt engineer and Google's Gemini to help you get better at Leetcode! LeetCoach will walk you through the problem giving you hints on the data structure, pseudocode, and even analyzing the code you've written! The best way to learn is to struggle and to work through it, and I hope LeetCoach will help you as much as it has helped me.</p>
